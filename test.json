        "definition_en": "Arises when the variables under study are affected by the selection of hospitalized subjects leading to a bias between the exposure and the disease under study.\n\nBerkson’s bias: first described by Berkson in 1946 for casecontrol studies.19 It is produced when the probability of hospitalisation of cases and controls differ, and it is also influenced by the exposure. See Feinstein et al20 and Flanders et al21 for a discussion and solution. ",
        "definition": "入院率偏倚，如果以医院的入院患者作为研究对象时，容易出现这种偏倚。因为所选的病例或对照仅是某种疾病患者中的一部分，而不是其所对应目标总体的无偏样本，这种选择研究对象的方法影响了组间的可比性或研究人群的代表性，最终导致暴露与结局的关系出现偏倚。\n\nBerkson 在1946年首次描述了病例对照研究中产生的此种偏倚。当病例和对照组的住院概率不同时，就会产生这种偏倚，而且，还会受到暴露的影响。见 Feinstein 等人和 Flanders等人的讨论和解决方案。\n\n入院率偏倚常见于病例对照研究。\n ",
        "background_en": "The combination of exposure to a risk and occurrence of the disease makes it more likely that an individual will be admitted to hospital. In a case-control study, this means the hospital cases could have higher risk exposures or disease than cases from the population at large. This can affect the estimates of the association between the exposure and the disease.\n\nAdmission bias is also known as Berkson’s bias (Berkson 1946). His original work involved a retrospective study examining disease risk factors from a hospital in-patient population. Berkson’s choice of inpatients resulted in a spurious association between the disease and the risk factors under study",
        "background": "暴露和结局疾病发生都可能使患者有更高的概率住院或就医。在病例对照研究中，这意味着“医院病例”可能比一般人群中的病例具有更高的暴露或结局疾病风险，这可能会影响对暴露与疾病之间关联的估计。\n\n最初，Berkson 是在一项“在入院患者中研究疾病风险因素”的回顾性研究中涉及到此偏倚的，以入院患者作为研究对象导致了疾病与所研究的风险因素之间的虚假关联。",
        "example_en": "Berkson described assessment of the relationship between gallbladder disease (as a possible cause) and diabetes. Because the study involved participants attending a clinic, whose attendance (overall) was affected both by gallbladder disease and by diabetes, this biased the association between gallbladder disease and diabetes.  (Berkson 1946).\n\nIn a more recent example, researchers looked at blood pressure among people attending a hospital clinic with recurrent attacks of a migraine or headaches and found that the prevalence of high blood pressure was about 38% compared with the general population rate of  11%. They suggested those attending a hospital clinic are likely to have more associations between the two medical conditions than those present in the general population (Prudenzano et al. 2005).\n\nSackett (1979) tested for Berkson’s bias in interviews of random samples of the general population to determine the presence or absence of respiratory disease and locomotor disease.  He then looked at the same thing for those within the sample who had been hospitalised in the previous six months. The results are in the table:\n\nIn the hospital sample, people with respiratory disease are much more likely to suffer from locomotor disease (Relative odds 4.06). We might conclude (incorrectly) there are associations between these two diseases.\n\nIf we looked at the general population, we would conclude there is no association between the two diseases (Relative odds 1.06) – the correct conclusion. The incorrect conclusion arises because people who have both disorders are more likely to be hospitalised.\n\n",
        "example": " Berkson 评估了胆囊疾病与糖尿病之间的关联。因为该研究研究对象为到诊所就诊的患者，他们的入院率（总体）受到胆囊疾病和糖尿病的影响，这使胆囊疾病和糖尿病之间的关联产生了偏倚。 （ Berkson 1946 ）。\n\n研究人员观察了因偏头痛或头痛反复发作而到医院诊所就诊患者的血压，发现高血压的患病率约为38%，而普通人群的患病率为11%。他们认为，与普通人群相比，去医院诊所就诊的患者可能在这两种疾病之间存在更多关联（Prudenzano et al，2005 ）。 \n\nSackett (1979) 在对一般人群随机样本的观察中测试了入院率偏倚，以确定呼吸系统疾病和运动疾病的关联。他对样本中过去六个月住院的患者进行了同样的研究。结果显示：在医院样本中，患有呼吸系统疾病的患者更容易患运动疾病（比值比 4.06）。我们可能会得出这两种疾病之间存在关联的错误结论。如果我们观察普通人群，我们会得出结论，这两种疾病之间没有关联（比值比 1.06）即正确的结论。出现错误结论的原因是同时患有这两种疾病的人住院概率更高。",
        "impact_en": "Sackett’s 1979 paper points out that relative odds may be spuriously increased or reduced by the presence of admission rate bias.\n\nThere is evidence that having malaria increases your chances of suffering non-typhoidal salmonella infection. Researchers looking at this association suspected that Berkson’s bias would have an impact and that as a result, case-control studies of this association among patients in hospitals might give biased results.\n\nThe researchers did two case-control studies using two different methods of selecting controls (Krumkamp et al. 2016). In the first study, children with salmonella infection were classified as cases, and controls were uninfected.  A protective association between malaria and salmonella infection was found: pooled OR = 0.4. In the second study, children testing positive for salmonella were cases, and children with another type of bacterial infection (not salmonella) were controls. In this study, malaria was a risk factor for salmonella infection: pooled OR = 1.9\n\nIn this example, both the “exposure” of malaria and the “outcome” of salmonella infection were factors that caused people to attend hospital, affecting the relationship between these two outcomes. Berkson’s bias caused the result to be reversed from one study to the other.\n\nIn another example, researchers looked at risk factors for bladder cancer, the risk of which is increased by smoking (Sadetzki 2003). Using a hospital-based case-control study design, they found very little association between smoking and bladder cancer; however, looking again, they noted that rates of smoking were much higher in their sample than in the general population, for both the cases and controls. This may have distorted the nature of the relationship between smoking and bladder cancer.",
        "impact": "Sackett （1979）的论文指出，入院率偏倚的存在可能会虚假地增加或减少比值比（OR）。\n\n有证据表明，患有疟疾会增加感染非伤寒沙门氏菌的可能。此关联导致研究人员怀疑 入院率偏倚产生的影响，因此，医院患者之间的病例对照研究可能会给出有偏倚的关联性结果。\n研究人员进行了两项不同对照选择的病例对照研究（Krumkamp et al. 2016）。在第一项研究中，病例组由感染沙门氏菌的儿童组成，对照组未感染。发现疟疾和沙门氏菌感染之间存在保护性关联：合并 OR = 0.4。在第二项研究中，沙门氏菌检测呈阳性的儿童为病例，而患有另一种细菌感染（不是沙门氏菌）的儿童为对照。在这项研究中，疟疾是沙门氏菌感染的危险因素：合并 OR = 1.9 。在这个例子中，疟疾（“暴露”）和沙门氏菌感染（“结局”）都是导致人们就医的因素，这影响了两者之间的关联。 入院率偏倚导致两项研究的结论相反。\n\n在另一个例子中，研究人员观察了膀胱癌的风险因素，吸烟会增加膀胱癌的风险（Sadetzki 2003）。使用基于医院的病例对照研究中，他们发现吸烟和膀胱癌之间的关联很小；然而，再次检验数据后他们注意到，研究样本中，无论是病例还是对照组，吸烟率比一般人群高得多。这可能扭曲了吸烟和膀胱癌之间的关联。\n",
        "prevent_en": "Selection of appropriate controls for a case-control study is critical for obtaining the best possible information, and Berkson’s bias should be considered and plans made to avoid this wherever possible. In a study using data from hospitalised cases it might be preferable to use matching controls which are also in hospital, but using controls from the general population is better, to avoid Berkson’s bias.\n\nIndirect Berkson’s bias (exposure-disease associations that arise because another disease is associated with the exposure under study) is attenuated mainly by using incident cases (i.e. not prevalent, already-existing cases). It can also be avoided by excluding patients who have been hospitalised because of another disease.\n\nWhen an association between an exposure and an outcome is known to affect the selection of cases and controls into a study (e.g. in a hospital setting), it is preferable to adjust the analysis to try to deal with this bias.",
        "prevent": "对病例对照研究来讲，选择适当的对照至关重要，应考虑入院率偏倚，并应该尽可能避免这种偏倚。在一项使用住院患者数据的病例对照研究中，研究者可能偏好用同一医院内的患者进行”匹配“，形成对照组，但为了避免入院率的偏倚，用来自普通人群的研究对象作为对照更好。\n\n非直接的入院率偏倚（暴露-疾病的关联是由于另一种疾病与所研究的暴露的关联而引发的），主要通过使用”新发病例“（即不是现患的病例即已经存在的病例）来控制。用新患病例可以排除因其他疾病住院的患者，所以可以避免这种偏倚。\n\n当已知具有关联的”暴露和结局“会影响研究中病例和对照的选择（例如，研究设置以医院环境为基础的研究，”暴露和结局“均会影响患者就医或入院）时，最好采用”校正分析“以尝试处理这种偏倚。",
