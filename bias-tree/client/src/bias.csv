b001,"Admission rate bias
（Berkson's bias）",入院率偏倚（伯克森偏倚）,Arises when the variables under study are affected by the selection of hospitalized subjects leading to a bias between the exposure and the disease under study.,"以医院住院患者为研究对象，这种受试者的选择，影响了研究中的变量，导致暴露与研究中的疾病（结局）之间存在偏倚时，就会出现这种偏倚。

Onion：X、Y都影响”医院就医或入院“，而不是”入院“影响X、Y。应为Berkson's bias 是一种”选择偏倚“，在DAG图上应该呈现Colliper（对撞机）。","The combination of exposure to a risk and occurrence of the disease makes it more likely that an individual will be admitted to hospital. In a case-control study, this means the hospital cases could have higher risk exposures or disease than cases from the population at large. This can affect the estimates of the association between the exposure and the disease.

Admission bias is also known as Berkson’s bias (Berkson 1946). His original work involved a retrospective study examining disease risk factors from a hospital in-patient population. Berkson’s choice of inpatients resulted in a spurious association between the disease and the risk factors under study","暴露于风险和疾病的发生相结合，使个人更有可能住院。在病例对照研究中，这意味着医院病例可能比一般人群的病例具有更高的风险暴露或疾病。这可能会影响对暴露与疾病之间关联的估计。

入院率偏倚也称为伯克森偏倚（Berkson 1946）。他最初的工作涉及一项回顾性研究，检查医院住院患者的疾病风险因素。伯克森对住院患者的选择导致疾病与研究中的危险因素之间存在虚假关联","Berkson described assessment of the relationship between gallbladder disease (as a possible cause) and diabetes. Because the study involved participants attending a clinic, whose attendance (overall) was affected both by gallbladder disease and by diabetes, this biased the association between gallbladder disease and diabetes.  (Berkson 1946).

In a more recent example, researchers looked at blood pressure among people attending a hospital clinic with recurrent attacks of a migraine or headaches and found that the prevalence of high blood pressure was about 38% compared with the general population rate of  11%. They suggested those attending a hospital clinic are likely to have more associations between the two medical conditions than those present in the general population (Prudenzano et al. 2005).

Sackett (1979) tested for Berkson’s bias in interviews of random samples of the general population to determine the presence or absence of respiratory disease and locomotor disease.  He then looked at the same thing for those within the sample who had been hospitalised in the previous six months. The results are in the table:

In the hospital sample, people with respiratory disease are much more likely to suffer from locomotor disease (Relative odds 4.06). We might conclude (incorrectly) there are associations between these two diseases.

If we looked at the general population, we would conclude there is no association between the two diseases (Relative odds 1.06) – the correct conclusion. The incorrect conclusion arises because people who have both disorders are more likely to be hospitalised.

","伯克森评估了胆囊疾病（作为可能的自变量—X变量）与糖尿病（Y变量，结局变量）之间的关联。因为该研究涉及到诊所的就诊患者，他们的入院率（就诊率）（总体）受到胆囊疾病和糖尿病的影响，这使胆囊疾病和糖尿病之间的关联产生了偏倚。 （伯克森 1946 年）。

在最近的一个例子中，研究人员观察了因偏头痛或头痛反复发作而到医院诊所就诊的人的血压，发现高血压的患病率约为38%，而普通人群的患病率为11%。他们认为，与普通人群相比，去医院诊所就诊的人可能在这两种疾病之间存在更多关联（Prudenzano 等人，2005 年）。 

Sackett (1979) 在对普通人群随机样本的访谈中测试了伯克森的偏见，以确定是否存在呼吸系统疾病和运动疾病。然后，他对样本中过去六个月住院的人进行了同样的研究。结果在表中：在医院样本中，患有呼吸系统疾病的人更容易患运动疾病（相对几率 4.06）。我们可能会得出（错误地）这两种疾病之间存在关联的结论。如果我们观察普通人群，我们会得出结论，这两种疾病之间没有关联（相对几率 1.06）——这是正确的结论。出现错误的结论是因为同时患有这两种疾病的人更有可能住院。","Sackett’s 1979 paper points out that relative odds may be spuriously increased or reduced by the presence of admission rate bias.

There is evidence that having malaria increases your chances of suffering non-typhoidal salmonella infection. Researchers looking at this association suspected that Berkson’s bias would have an impact and that as a result, case-control studies of this association among patients in hospitals might give biased results.

The researchers did two case-control studies using two different methods of selecting controls (Krumkamp et al. 2016). In the first study, children with salmonella infection were classified as cases, and controls were uninfected.  A protective association between malaria and salmonella infection was found: pooled OR = 0.4. In the second study, children testing positive for salmonella were cases, and children with another type of bacterial infection (not salmonella) were controls. In this study, malaria was a risk factor for salmonella infection: pooled OR = 1.9

In this example, both the “exposure” of malaria and the “outcome” of salmonella infection were factors that caused people to attend hospital, affecting the relationship between these two outcomes. Berkson’s bias caused the result to be reversed from one study to the other.

In another example, researchers looked at risk factors for bladder cancer, the risk of which is increased by smoking (Sadetzki 2003). Using a hospital-based case-control study design, they found very little association between smoking and bladder cancer; however, looking again, they noted that rates of smoking were much higher in their sample than in the general population, for both the cases and controls. This may have distorted the nature of the relationship between smoking and bladder cancer.","Sackett 1979 年的论文指出，入院率偏倚的存在可能会虚假地增加或减少相对odd。

有证据表明，患有疟疾会增加您感染非伤寒沙门氏菌的机会。研究这种关联的研究人员怀疑伯克森的偏倚会产生影响，因此，医院患者之间这种关联的病例对照研究可能会给出有偏倚的结果。

研究人员使用两种不同的选择对照方法进行了两项病例对照研究（Krumkamp et al. 2016）。在第一项研究中，感染沙门氏菌的儿童被归类为病例，对照组未感染。发现疟疾和沙门氏菌感染之间存在保护性关联：合并 OR = 0.4。在第二项研究中，沙门氏菌检测呈阳性的儿童为病例，而患有另一种细菌感染（不是沙门氏菌）的儿童为对照。在这项研究中，疟疾是沙门氏菌感染的危险因素：汇总 OR = 1.9 。

在这个例子中，疟疾（“暴露”）和沙门氏菌感染（“结果”）都是导致人们就医的因素，影响了这些因素之间的关系两个结果。伯克森偏倚导致一项研究的结果到另一项研究的结果发生了逆转。

在另一个例子中，研究人员研究了膀胱癌的危险因素，吸烟会增加膀胱癌的风险（Sadetzki 2003）。使用基于医院患者的病例对照研究设计，他们发现吸烟与膀胱癌之间几乎没有关联。然而，再看一遍，他们注意到样本中，无论是病例组还是对照组吸烟率远高于普通人群。这可能扭曲了吸烟与膀胱癌之间关系的性质。

onion：【X（暴露）、Y（结局）都影响就医率、就诊率】+【以医院患者进行病例对照研究】。","Selection of appropriate controls for a case-control study is critical for obtaining the best possible information, and Berkson’s bias should be considered and plans made to avoid this wherever possible. In a study using data from hospitalised cases it might be preferable to use matching controls which are also in hospital, but using controls from the general population is better, to avoid Berkson’s bias.

Indirect Berkson’s bias (exposure-disease associations that arise because another disease is associated with the exposure under study) is attenuated mainly by using incident cases (i.e. not prevalent, already-existing cases). It can also be avoided by excluding patients who have been hospitalised because of another disease.

When an association between an exposure and an outcome is known to affect the selection of cases and controls into a study (e.g. in a hospital setting), it is preferable to adjust the analysis to try to deal with this bias.","为病例对照研究来讲，选择适当的对照至关重要，应考虑伯克森偏倚，并应该尽可能避免这种偏倚。在一项使用住院患者数据的病例对照研究中，研究者可能偏好用同一医院内的患者进行”匹配“，形成对照组，但为了避免伯克森的偏倚，用来自普通人群的研究对象作为对照更好。

间接伯克森偏倚（暴露-疾病的关联是由于另一种疾病与所研究的暴露的关联而引发的），主要通过使用”新发病例“（即不是现患的病例、已经存在的病例）来减弱。用新患病例可以排除因其他疾病住院的患者，所以可以避免这种偏倚。

当已知具有关联的”暴露和结局“会影响研究中病例和对照的选择（例如，研究设置以医院环境为基础的研究，”暴露和结局“均会影响患者就医或入院）时，最好采用”校正分析“以尝试处理这种偏倚。","Berkson J. Limitations of the application of fourfold table analysis to hospital data. Biometrics. 1946; 2(3): 47–53 [reprinted in Int J Epidemiol 2014; 43(2): 511-15].

The mechanism for how this might happen is not clear although it might be imagined that it could take place either subconsciously, or consciously by those who have vested interests in maintaining the currently dominant theory.",All's well 文献偏见是指对主流理论存在偏倚的情况，这种偏倚在某种程度上排除了相反理论证据的发表。这种情况发生的机制尚不清楚，尽管可以想象它可能是在潜意识中发生的，也可能是那些在维持当前主导理论中有既得利益的人有意为之。,"Sackett was referring to editorials that can be a repository for all well’s literature bias due to the predominance of opinion.

In the NEJM example, for almost 50 years, since insulin therapy was initiated, proponents of “rigid,” “tight” or “chemical” control quoted retrospective evidence of decreased or delayed nephropathy and retinopathy as glucose levels are brought by therapy toward the normal range. Opponents pointed to the complications in many of these patients. (Cahill 1976)","Sackett 指的是由于主导舆论，编辑述评可以成为引用偏见的仓库。

b003,Allocation bias ,分配偏倚,Systematic difference in how participants are assigned to comparison groups in a clinical trial.,在临床试验中，将受试者分配到各组的系统差异。,"Allocation bias may result if investigators know or predict which intervention the next eligible participant is supposed to receive. This knowledge may influence the way investigators approach potentially eligible participants and how they are assigned to the different groups, thereby selecting participants with good prognoses (i.e. anticipated good outcomes and treatment responses) into one group more than another.

In a trial of different blood pressure medications the use of sealed envelopes to conceal the allocation schedule resulted in imbalances in baseline blood pressure between the treatment and control groups. In turned out that participants in the control group already had lower blood pressures compared to participants in the treatment group at the outset. The observed imbalance could have arisen if the investigator opened the envelopes before allocating participants to groups.","如果研究人员知道或可能预测下一个符合条件的研究受试者应该接受哪种干预措施，则可能会导致分配偏倚。这种预知可能既会影响研究人员接近受试者（可能合格的受试者）的方式，又可能影响入组分配的方式。研究者可能根据自己对受试者预后的预判（即预期的良好结果和治疗反应），倾向于将受试者分配到可能具有良好预后的一个组中去。

在对不同血压药物的试验中，使用密封信封来隐藏分配表导致治疗组和对照组之间的基线血压不平衡。事实证明，与治疗组的受试者相比，对照组的受试者入组时的血压就较低。如果研究人员在将受试者者分配到组之前打开信封，则可能会出现这种不平衡。

有一位著名专家说过这件事，关于伦理方面的。很多医生认为随机分组有碍伦理。","In the nine trials using good allocation concealment, there was no detected effect of hypothermia treatment on death, whereas in the trials that did not conceal allocation there was a 38% reduction in the risk of death. Hypothermia for traumatic head injury.

Trials in which allocation was inadequately concealed reported estimates that were between 7% and 40% larger than effects in trials in which allocation was adequately concealed, although the size and direction of the effect were not predictable. A simulation of trials showed that, due to knowledge of previous allocations, as many as 1 in 5 trials could conclude that there was a difference when in fact there was not.

Trials with inadequate allocation concealment yield estimates that are up to 40% larger than those that do not. Empirical evidence of bias. JAMA. 1995.",有证据表明，超过 80% 的试验分配隐藏不明确。分配未充分隐藏的试验报告的估计值比分配充分隐藏的试验中的效应大 7% 至 40%，尽管效应的大小和方向不可预测。对试验的模拟表明，由于对先前分配的了解，多达五分之一的试验可以得出具有”显著性差异“的结论，而实际上并没有差异。”分配隐藏不足“的试验较没有分配隐藏不足的试验，产生的估计值高出 40%。——Empirical evidence of bias. JAMA. 1995.,"Some standard methods of ensuring concealment of group allocation prior to allocation include sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (SNOSE); sequentially numbered containers; pharmacy controlled allocation; and central allocation.

When trialists do more to show that group allocation (prior to allocation) was concealed, this permits more confidence that allocation bias has not affected the study’s results. For example, an audit trail can be recorded for sequentially numbered envelopes; sequentially numbered containers should look identical to each other from the outside; study staff should have correct training for maintaining allocation concealment; the block sizes for randomization should not be known; and all these features of the trial should be reported in the trial publications.

Where cluster randomisation or minimisation are used in the allocation to treatment or control groups, it may not be possible to prevent future allocations being predictable and thus concealment might not be adequate. In such cases, pre-defined statistical adjustments (e.g. covariate analysis) can be considered and should be reported in trial publications.

Researchers should try to understand the reasons for allocation concealment and the problems that can arise if a robust trial protocol including allocation concealment is not followed. Allocation concealment procedures should also be specified in a trial’s protocol, and reported in detail in any publication of the trial’s results.","确保在分配前隐藏组分配的一些标准方法包括：按序列编号、不透明、密封的信封 (SNOSE)；按序列号的密封盒；药房控制分配；和中央分配。

当研究者更多地表明组分配（分配之前）被隐藏时，会使得”分配偏倚“没有影响研究结果的信心更大。例如，可以跟踪记录为”序列号“的信封；序列号密封盒从外面看起来应该彼此相同；研究人员应接受正确的培训以保持分配隐藏；不应该知道随机化的区组大小；试验的所有特点都应在试验文献中报告。

如果使用整群随机化或最小化进行分配（分配至治疗组或对照组）时，则可能无法防止未来的分配是可预测的，因此隐藏可能不够。在这种情况下，可以考虑预先定义的统计调整（例如协变量分析），并应在试验出版物中报告。

研究人员应了解分配隐藏的原因，以及如果不遵循包括分配隐藏的稳健试验方案的话，可能出现的问题。分配隐藏程序也应在试验方案中详细说明，并在试验结果的任何出版物中详细报告。","Berger VW et al. Allocation concealment continues to be misunderstood. J Clin Epidemiol 2010; 63 (4): 468–470

b004,Apprehension bias,恐惧偏见,When a study participant responds differently due to being observed,当研究受试者因被观察时而做出不同反应。,"The fact or process of investigation can result in measurements being different from the usual for a study participant.

This can partly be due to behavioural change, as described in the Hawthorne effect, which can be to some extent a conscious response to being studied. In addition, this reaction to being studied can result in altered physiological measurements, presumably largely unconsciously, and this can be termed apprehension bias.","调查的结果或过程可能导致测量结果与研究受试者的通常情况不同。

这可能部分是由于行为变化，如霍桑效应所述，这在某种程度上可能是对被研究的有意识的反应。此外，这种对被研究的反应可能会导致生理测量值的改变，这可能在很大程度上是无意识的，这可以称为恐惧偏倚。","A well-documented example of apprehension bias could be found in the measurement of hypertension. According to Cobos 2015, this was first described by Riva-Rocci in 1896.

Patients could become anxious as a result of visiting their health professional. They may also become anxious at the thought of having their blood pressure taken before it has actually been taken.  As a result, this could raise their blood pressure, giving a biased record of what their physiological blood pressure actually is (Grassi 2016).",在高血压的测量中可以找到一个有据可查的忧虑偏倚示例。根据 Cobos 2015 年的报道，由 Riva-Rocci 于 1896 年首次描述。患者可能会因拜访他们的医疗专家而变得焦虑。他们可能会因为在实际测量血压之前就已经测量过血压而感到焦虑。结果，这可能会导致他们的血压升高，从而对他们的生理血压的实际值给出有偏倚的记录（Grassi 2016）。,"Probably the most common example of the potential impact from apprehension bias can be seen in the measurement of blood pressure – where the term “white coat hypertension” or “white coat effect” or “white coat syndrome” is sometimes used. In this context, a persons blood pressure is artificially elevated in a medical setting than when taken at home.

A review of sources of inaccuracy within blood pressure reporting among 41 studies found that 37 showed an average increase in blood pressure measured in a clinic, as compared with other settings, typically, an ambulatory measurement (Kallioinen et al 2017).

The size of the average difference between measurement methods varied widely. This discrepancy between clinic-based and ambulatory measurements may represent apprehension bias, and this example shows it can have an unpredictable effect on observations.

Apprehension bias, in the form of white coat hypertension, can have negative impacts on health. Another systematic review (Cohen 2016) examined the impact of white coat hypertension on cardiovascular events and mortality. The review found that compared with people with normal blood pressure, untreated WCH was associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events, hazard ratio, 1.36 (95% CI, 1.03 to 2.00), all-cause mortality 1.33 (1.07 to 1.67), and cardiovascular mortality, HR, 2.09 (1.23 to 4.48)","可能最常见的恐惧偏见潜在影响的例子可以在血压测量中看到——有时使用术语“白大衣高血压”或“白大衣效应”或“白大衣综合征”。在这种情况下，一个人的血压在医疗环境中比在家中被人为升高。

对 41 项研究中血压报告不准确来源的回顾中发现，与其他环境（通常是动态测量）相比，37 项研究显示在诊所测量的血压平均升高（Kallioinen 等人，2017 年）。

测量方法之间的平均差值大小差异很大。临床测量和动态测量之间的差异可能代表“恐惧偏倚”，这个例子表明它可能对观察结果产生不可预测的影响。

以白大衣高血压（white coat hypertension，WCH）的形式出现的“恐惧偏倚”会对健康产生负面影响。另一项系统评价 (Cohen 2016) 研究了白大衣高血压对心血管事件和死亡率的影响。该评价发现，与血压正常的人相比，未经治疗的 WCH 与心血管事件风险增加相关，风险比为 1.36（95% CI，1.03 至 2.00），全因死亡率为 1.33（1.07 至 1.67），以及心血管死亡率，HR，2.09（1.23 至 4.48）","Strategies to avoid apprehension bias include methods to reduce the anxiety of study participants. When considering blood pressure readings, the evidence for self-monitoring of blood pressures (where patients take their own blood pressure, usually in their own homes) and ambulatory automated equipment has grown.

b005,Ascertainment bias,确定偏倚,Systematic differences in the identification of individuals included in a study or distortion in the collection of data in a study.,识别研究中包含的个体的系统性差异，或研究中数据收集的失真。,"Ascertainment bias arises when data for a study or an analysis are collected (or surveyed, screened, or recorded) such that some members of the target population are less likely to be included in the final results than others. The resulting study sample becomes biased, as it is systematically different from the target population. Ascertainment bias is related to sampling bias, selection bias, detection bias, and observer bias.

Ascertainment bias can happen when there is more intense surveillance or screening for outcomes among exposed individuals than among unexposed individuals, or differential recording of outcomes.

Ascertainment bias can occur in screening, where take-up can be influenced by factors such as cultural differences. It can occur in case-control studies in the initial identification of cases and controls, which can be skewed by relevant exposures, leading to biased estimates of associations.

In a clinical trial, if allocation concealment and blinding are lacking, then outcome ascertainment can be influenced by knowledge of the allocation.","当一项研究或分析的数据收集（或调查、筛选或记录），目标人群中的某部分成员比其他成员纳入研究的概率更低时，就会出现确定偏倚。由此产生的研究样本变得有偏倚，因为它与目标人群存在系统差异。确定偏倚与抽样偏倚、选择偏倚、检测偏倚和观察者偏倚有关。

当暴露个体比未暴露个体对结局进行更严格的监测或筛查，或结局的记录存在误差时，可能会发生确定偏倚。

筛选过程中可能会出现确定性偏倚，其中接受度可能会受到文化差异等因素的影响。它可能发生在病例对照研究中，最初识别病例和对照的时侯，可能会受到相关暴露的影响，从而导致对关联的估计有偏倚。

在临床试验中，如果缺乏分配隐藏和盲法，那么结果确定可能会受到分配的预知的影响。","In a Cochrane systematic review “Helmets for preventing head and facial injuries in bicyclists”, the authors examined information from five case-control studies. These studies obtained information from cyclists who had crashed or fallen. Cases were cyclists suffering head, or facial injuries and controls were cyclists suffering other injuries. In this situation, ascertainment bias could occur if information on helmet wearing was obtained differently for cases and controls.

In describing how to avoid ascertainment bias, the authors write:“In order to study facial injuries, cases should be limited to serious injuries (lacerations and fractures) that would result in an emergency department visit whether or not a head injury was also present. People with minor facial injuries may be identified because bicyclists seek care for head injuries.” This example illustrates how biased screening for the outcome can lead to ascertainment bias.

A database analysis found that rates of Alzheimer’s disease were lower among higher users of statins; a letter commenting on this study suggested that some or all of this observed association may be due to ascertainment bias: Alzheimer’s diagnosis requires contact with a doctor and statins use might be associated with frequency of visiting the doctor.","在 Cochrane 系统评价“防止骑自行车者头部和面部受伤的头盔”中，作者检查了来自五项病例对照研究的信息。这些研究从撞车或摔倒的骑自行车者那里获得了信息。病例是头部受伤或面部受伤的骑自行车者，对照组是遭受其他伤害的骑自行车者。在这种情况下，如果对病例和对照组的头盔佩戴信息的获取方式不同，则可能会出现确定偏倚。

在描述如何避免确定偏倚时，作者写道：“为了研究面部损伤，病例应仅限于严重损伤（撕裂和骨折），无论是否存在头部损伤，都会导致急诊科就诊。由于骑自行车的人寻求头部受伤的治疗，因此可能会识别出面部轻微受伤的人。”这个例子说明了对结果的筛选偏倚如何导致了确定偏倚。

一项数据库分析发现，在他汀类药物使用较多的人群中，阿尔茨海默病的发病率较低；一封评论这项研究的信表明，观察到的这种关联部分或全部可能是由于确定偏倚：阿尔茨海默病的诊断需要与医生联系，他汀类药物的使用可能与就诊频率有关。",We have not identified studies reporting the empirical impact of ascertainment bias.,我们尚未确定报告确定偏倚的经验影响的研究。,"Appropriate inclusion of cases and controls within case-control studies is essential to avoid ascertainment bias.

b006,Attrition bias,脱落偏倚（网上翻译可见”失访偏倚）,Unequal loss of participants from study groups in a trial.,试验中研究组的受试者失访不均衡。,"Attrition occurs when participants leave during a study. It almost always happens to some extent.

Different rates of loss to follow-up in the exposure groups, or losses of different types of participants, whether at similar or different frequencies, may change the characteristics of the groups, irrespective of the exposure or intervention. Losses may be influenced by such factors as unsatisfactory treatment efficacy or intolerable adverse events.

When participants leave, it may not be known whether they continue or discontinue an intervention; there may be no data on outcomes for these participants after that time.

Systematic differences between people who leave the study and those who continue can introduce bias into a study’s results – this is attrition bias. However, the results may not necessarily be biased, despite different drop-out rates in the groups. We discuss below how to assess the impact of different amounts of attrition.

In some cases, those who leave a study are likely to be different from those who continue. For instance, in an intervention study of diet in people with depression, those with more severe depression might find it harder to adhere to the diet regimen and therefore more likely to leave the study.","当受试者在研究期间脱落时，就会发生流失。它几乎总是在某种程度上发生。

所有暴露组中不同的失访率，或不同类型受试者的失访，无论是相似还是不同的频率，都可能改变组的特征，而与暴露或干预无关。失访可能受到治疗效果不理想或无法忍受的不良事件等因素的影响。

当受试者脱落时，可能不知道他们是否还继续还干预；在此之后，可能没有这些受试者的结局数据。

研究脱落的受试者和继续研究的受试者之间的系统性差异会在研究结局时引入偏倚——这就是流失偏倚。然而，各组的脱落率不同，结果可能不一定存在偏倚。我们将在下面讨论如何评估不同脱落量的影响。

在某些情况下，研究脱落的受试者可能与继续研究的受试者不同。例如，在一项针对抑郁症患者的饮食干预研究中，患有更严重抑郁症的受试者可能更难坚持饮食方案，因此更有可能退出研究。","A study of psychosocial factors among patients with cardiac conditions showed that those who fully completed the study differed in clinical and psychosocial features from those who dropped out before the study ended. Such differential attrition could have biased the study’s results.

A trial investigating the quality of life among patients randomised to aggressive treatment of renal cancer had high rates of attrition owing to toxicity, disease progression, and deaths (64% in the control group; 70% in the intervention group). Analysis of those still in the trial showed no difference in the quality of life. The impact of attrition bias, however, suggested that even with equal drop-outs in both groups a biased estimate occurred.","一项对心脏病患者心理社会因素的研究表明，完全完成研究的受试者与研究结束前脱落的受试者在临床和社会心理特征方面存在差异。这种差异化的脱落可能会使研究结果产生偏倚。

一项调查随机接受肾癌积极治疗的患者的生活质量的试验，由于中毒、疾病进展和死亡（对照组为 64%；干预组为 70%）而导致的高脱落率。对仍在试验中的受试者的分析表明，生活质量没有差异。然而，脱落偏倚的影响表明，即使两组的脱落率相同，也会出现有偏倚的估计。

Zx-脱落率相近，但仍存在偏倚。脱落率高就不行！","A systematic review assessed the reporting, extent, and handling of loss to follow-up and its potential impact, on treatment effects in randomised controlled trials published in the five top medical journals, The authors calculated the percentage of trials in which the relative risk would no longer be significant when participants loss to follow-up varied. In 160 trials, with an average loss to follow-up of 6%, and assuming different event rates in the intervention groups relative to the control groups, between 0% and 33% of trials were no longer significant.

Potential impact on estimated treatment effects of information lost to follow-up in randomised controlled trials (LOST-IT): a systematic review. BMJ 2012;344:e2809.","Techniques for preventing losses follow-up include ensuring good communication between study staff and participants, accessibility to clinics, effective communication channels, incentives to continue, and ensuring that the study is of relevance to the participants.

However, for many studies, complete follow up is unlikely. In such cases, the reasons for attrition should be carefully considered. After the study has been completed, a number of analysis methods can be used to reduce the impact of attrition bias.

Intention to treat analysis: Because anything that happens after randomisation can affect the chance that a study participant has the outcome of interest, it is important that all patients (even those who fail to take their medicine or accidentally or intentionally receive the wrong treatment) are analysed in the groups to which they were allocated.

It is important that we not only look for the term ‘intention-to-treat analysis’ in the methods but also look at the results to ensure that the analysis was actually done.

Methods for dealing with missing data include last observation (or baseline value) carried forward, mixed models, imputation and sensitivity analysis using ‘worst case’ scenarios (assuming that those with no information all got worse) and ‘best case’ scenarios (assuming that all got better). Analysing data only from participants remaining in the study is called complete case analysis.  

A rule of thumb states that <5% attrition leads to little bias, while >20% poses serious threats to validity. While this is useful, it is important to note that even small proportions of patients lost to follow-up can cause significant bias. One way to determine whether losses to follow-up can seriously affect results is to assume a worst-case scenario for the outcomes in those with missing data and look to see if the results would change. If this method doesn’t change the study’s conclusions, the loss to follow-up is likely not a threat to the study’s validity.

Regardless of the mechanisms used to obtain estimates of outcome data, the reasons that participants leave the study should be carefully considered:  if people leave for reasons unrelated to the exposure (treatment) or the outcome this may have little or no impact on the results.","预防失访的技术包括：确保研究人员和受试者之间的良好沟通、诊所的可及性、有效的沟通渠道、激励受试者继续进行研究、以及确保研究与受试者相关。

然而，对于许多研究而言，不太可能进行完整的随访。在这种情况下，应仔细考虑失访的原因。研究完成后，可以使用多种分析方法来减少失访偏倚的影响。

治疗意向分析：因为随机分组后发生的任何事情都可能影响研究受试者获得结局的机会，所以所有患者（即使是那些未能服药或意外或故意接受错误治疗的患者）都非常重要，将他们按照被分配到的组中进行分析。

重要的是，我们不仅要在报告的“方法部分”中寻找“意向治疗分析”一词，还要查看结果以确保分析确实完成。

处理缺失数据的方法包括：末次观察（或基线值）结转、混合模型、使用“最坏情况”情景（将没有信息的情况都视作最坏结果）和“最佳情况”情景（将没有信息的情况都视作最佳结果）。仅分析研究中剩余受试者的数据称为完整案例分析。

经验法则指出，<5% 的流失率几乎不会导致偏倚，而 >20% 的流失率会对效度构成严重影响。虽然这很有用，但重要的是要注意，即使是一小部分失访的患者也会导致严重的偏倚。确定失访是否会严重影响结果的一种方法是假设那些缺少数据的结果都是最坏情况，并查看结果是否会改变。如果这种方法不改变研究的结论，那么失访可能不会对研究的效度构成威胁。

无论用于获得结果数据估计的机制如何，都应仔细考虑受试者失访的原因：如果受试者失访的原因与暴露（治疗）或结局无关，这可能对结果影响很小或没有影响。","Akl AE et al. Potential impact on estimated treatment effects of information lost to follow-up in randomised controlled trials (LOST-IT): systematic review. BMJ 2012; 344: e2809.

b007,Availability bias,易得性偏倚,"A distortion that arises from the use of information which is most readily available, rather than that which is necessarily most representative.",由于使用最容易获得的信息而不是必然最具代表性的信息而产生的扭曲。,"All research questions and decisions, whether considering diagnostic accuracy of a test or effectiveness of an intervention, involve interpretation of data. Clinical decisions are based on data, which may be from routine care, published evidence, guidelines or clinician preference or experience.

Patients decide how to proceed, in health or healthcare, based on information which may come from a variety of sources, including health professionals, published data (particularly lay press) and their environment and experiences. The common thread running through all three areas is their basis in available data.

Availability bias occurs due to the natural human tendency to rely disproportionately upon the most readily available data. It can also occur in the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare if algorithms place greater emphasis on the most readily available data which does not fully represent the target population.

Availability of information can be influenced by spin bias, biases of rhetoric, perception bias and recall bias. Confirmation bias (when information is sought and used to support pre-existing beliefs) may lead to availability bias if data not supporting these beliefs is disregarded and not available for a particular decision or analysis.","所有研究问题和决策，无论是考虑测试的诊断准确性或者干预的有效性，都涉及数据解释。临床决策基于数据，这些数据可能来自于常规医疗、已发表的证据、指南或临床医生的偏好或经验。

在健康或医疗保健方面，患者根据获得的信息决定如何进行治疗（这些信息可能包括：医疗专业人员、已发表的数据（尤其是非专业媒体）及其环境和经验）。这三个方面信息的共同点是：它们是容易获得的数据。

易得性偏倚的出现是由于人类自然的、不成比例地、倾向于依赖最容易获得的数据。在医疗保健领域使用人工智能时，如果算法更强调最容易获得的数据，而不能完全代表目标人群，那么也可能出现这种偏倚。

信息的易得性会受到Spin bias、spin bias, biases of rhetoric, perception bias、和回忆偏倚的影响。如果不支持这些信念的数据被忽视并且不可用于特定决策或分析，则确认偏倚（当寻求并使用信息来支持预先存在的信念时）可能会导致易得性偏倚。","Researchers at Erasmus University, Rotterdam, set out to assess whether junior doctors (first- and second-year residents) based their diagnoses on recent clinical experience (the most recently available information).
