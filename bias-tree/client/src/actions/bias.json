            "background_en": "Hypothetical bias occurs when individuals report unrealistic behaviours or values to researchers in surveys or in experimental studies. In other words, what individuals say they would do hypothetically is not necessarily what they would do in reality.[1] This bias occurs in stated preference studies (individuals’ stated choices/valuations of goods/services), e.g. discrete choice experiments (DCEs), which are widely used across health sciences. Hypothetical bias impacts the validity of a study’s results. It is considered particularly prevalent in healthcare because there are many treatments and services that individuals may experience in the future or may not experience at all.\n\nHypothetical bias is thought to be linked to several factors, such as responses in stated preference settings being non-binding. As such, the implications to the individual of their responses are inconsequential (and respondents may not in fact agree with the policy implications of their own choices; see [2]). Moreover, the settings in which experiments or surveys are taken (e.g. online surveys) may be far removed from the settings in which the corresponding real-world behaviours are conducted (e.g. making decisions about treatment options in clinical settings). Lastly, respondents may respond strategically to surveys for a variety of reasons (e.g. report that they would use primary care services more often than they really would if they believed a new service would be opened closer to them on the basis of this [strategic] response to a survey.[3]\n\nAlthough hypothetical bias potentially arises in any stated preference study, its presence is difficult to detect. It is an issue that is commonly overlooked in health settings for a variety of reasons, such as having no real-world data to detect or correct for hypothetical bias.[4]",

(2018) demonstrate some discrepancies between predicted health behaviours (including treatments for sleep apnea, tuberculosis treatments, screening for Chlamydia, and preferences for pharmacy-based health checks) from DCEs and corresponding, actual health behaviours in the real world, “Pooled estimation suggests that the sensitivity of DCE predictions was relatively high (0.88, 95% CI 0.81, 0.92), whilst specificity was substantially lower (0.34, 95% CI 0.23, 0.46).

These are typically categorised as ex-ante approaches (i.e. implemented before reporting) or ex-post approaches (i.e. implemented after reporting) and are detailed below. It is worth noting that, “it is likely that a number of factors affect hypothetical bias and therefore no single technique will be the magic bullet that eliminates this bias”.[9]\n\nEx-ante approaches:\n\nCheap talk [10]: instructing respondents that their responses are feeding into important research that may impact on current clinical practise or policy. This approach aims to induce realistic behaviours by linking respondents’ responses to consequences (terms such as “consequentiality scripts” and “honesty pledges” have also been used to convey similar approaches).\nHonesty priming [11]: a technique from psychology in which respondents are required, prior to the experimental task, to make sentences from scrambled words, and the words are those associated with honesty, truthfulness, etc. Respondents are then said to be primed, meaning that they are subliminally encouraged to give truthful responses in the experimental tasks that follow.\nInferred valuation [12]: asking respondents to estimate others’, rather than their own, value of a good or service. This method removes an individual’s sense of agency in their valuation and as a consequence is thought to reduce self-related biases in valuations.\nIncentive compatibility [13: conditioning a reward (typically a financial reward), or the chance of a reward, on respondents’ choices. In this case, respondents’ choices are linked to a payoff, and hypothetical bias is said to be reduced.\nPivot designs [1]: embedding information on respondents’ own choices in the design of the experimental tasks to make the tasks more realistic and so to reduce hypothetical bias (see also “SP-off-RP” designs [14]).\nEx-post approaches:\n\nCertainty calibration [15]: asking respondents to indicate how certain they are that they would make their experimental choices in real-world settings. This information is then used to adjust models, termed calibration, in analyses so as to reduce hypothetical bias.\nRevealed preference calibration [10]: obtaining available market (i.e. real-world) data, in which individuals actually made choices, and adjusting – or calibrating – models using this data. Since uncalibrated models are based on experimental data, using real-world behaviour to make adjustments is thought to reduce hypothetical bias.",

When immortal time is misclassified or excluded during analysis, immortal time bias leads to a biased association. This usually happens when researchers assign participants to treated or exposed groups by using information that is observed after the participant enters the study (after time-zero). This is common in pharmacoepidemiological studies where there is a delay in classifying participants as ‘treated’ until they fill their first prescription some time after entering the study. Because these participants must have survived (be alive or event-free) the time between entering the cohort and filling their first prescription, they are considered ‘immortal’ and contribute ‘immortal time’ to the treated group by design. Bias is introduced when this period of ‘immortality’ is misclassified or excluded during analysis, resulting in a distortion of observed effects in favour of the treatment (or exposure) under study by conferring a spurious survival advantage to the treated (or exposed) group (Figure 1).\n",

In the original studies, immortal time bias was introduced because participants entered the cohort on the day they were discharged and were then assigned to the treated group if they filled a prescription for a corticosteroid within the first 90 days from discharge. By design, participants allocated to the treated group could not have died or been readmitted between the time of entering the cohort and the time of filling their first prescription. In effect, they contributed ‘immortal time’ to the treated group. The original studies misclassified this immortal person-time to the treated group (rather than the untreated group) and immortal time bias was induced (see Figure 2).[3]",

For example, a cohort study showed that statins could reduce the risk of diabetes progression (adjusted hazard ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.95). But in this study, they misclassified immortal time and used a naive time-fixed analysis. A proper time-dependent analysis that correctly classified immortal person-time to the untreated group reversed the effect and revealed that the hazard ratio was 1.97 (1.53 to 2.52).

Because the study involved participants attending a clinic, whose attendance (overall) was affected both by gallbladder disease and by diabetes, this biased the association between gallbladder disease and diabetes.

They suggested those attending a hospital clinic are likely to have more associations between the two medical conditions than those present in the general population (Prudenzano et al. 2005).\n\nSackett (1979) tested for Berkson’s bias in interviews of random samples of the general population to determine the presence or absence of respiratory disease and locomotor disease.  He then looked at the same thing for those within the sample who had been hospitalised in the previous six months. The results are in the table:\n\nIn the hospital sample, people with respiratory disease are much more likely to suffer from locomotor disease (Relative odds 4.06). We might conclude (incorrectly) there are associations between these two diseases.\n\nIf we looked at the general population, we would conclude there is no association between the two diseases (Relative odds 1.06) – the correct conclusion.

Researchers looking at this association suspected that Berkson’s bias would have an impact and that as a result, case-control studies of this association among patients in hospitals might give biased results.\n\nThe researchers did two case-control studies using two different methods of selecting controls (Krumkamp et al. 2016). In the first study, children with salmonella infection were classified as cases, and controls were uninfected.  A protective association between malaria and salmonella infection was found: pooled OR = 0.4. In the second study, children testing positive for salmonella were cases, and children with another type of bacterial infection (not salmonella) were controls. In this study, malaria was a risk factor for salmonella infection: pooled OR = 1.9\n\nIn this example, both the “exposure” of malaria and the “outcome” of salmonella infection were factors that caused people to attend hospital, affecting the relationship between these two outcomes. Berkson’s bias caused the result to be reversed from one study to the other.\n\nIn another example, researchers looked at risk factors for bladder cancer, the risk of which is increased by smoking (Sadetzki 2003). Using a hospital-based case-control study design, they found very little association between smoking and bladder cancer; however, looking again, they noted that rates of smoking were much higher in their sample than in the general population, for both the cases and controls.

It almost always happens to some extent.\n\nDifferent rates of loss to follow-up in the exposure groups, or losses of different types of participants, whether at similar or different frequencies, may change the characteristics of the groups, irrespective of the exposure or intervention. Losses may be influenced by such factors as unsatisfactory treatment efficacy or intolerable adverse events.\n\nWhen participants leave, it may not be known whether they continue or discontinue an intervention; there may be no data on outcomes for these participants after that time.\n\nSystematic differences between people who leave the study and those who continue can introduce bias into a study’s results – this is attrition bias. However, the results may not necessarily be biased, despite different drop-out rates in the groups. We discuss below how to assess the impact of different amounts of attrition.\n\nIn some cases, those who leave a study are likely to be different from those who continue. For instance, in an intervention study of diet in people with depression, those with more severe depression might find it harder to adhere to the diet regimen and therefore more likely to leave the study.",

In such cases, the reasons for attrition should be carefully considered. After the study has been completed, a number of analysis methods can be used to reduce the impact of attrition bias.\n\nIntention to treat analysis: Because anything that happens after randomisation can affect the chance that a study participant has the outcome of interest, it is important that all patients (even those who fail to take their medicine or accidentally or intentionally receive the wrong treatment) are analysed in the groups to which they were allocated.\n\nIt is important that we not only look for the term ‘intention-to-treat analysis’ in the methods but also look at the results to ensure that the analysis was actually done.\n\nMethods for dealing with missing data include last observation (or baseline value) carried forward, mixed models, imputation and sensitivity analysis using ‘worst case’ scenarios (assuming that those with no information all got worse) and ‘best case’ scenarios (assuming that all got better). Analysing data only from participants remaining in the study is called complete case analysis.  \n\nA rule of thumb states that <5% attrition leads to little bias, while >20% poses serious threats to validity. While this is useful, it is important to note that even small proportions of patients lost to follow-up can cause significant bias. One way to determine whether losses to follow-up can seriously affect results is to assume a worst-case scenario for the outcomes in those with missing data and look to see if the results would change.

He analysed data from 257 hospitalized individuals and detected an association between locomotor disease and respiratory disease (odds ratio 4.06). The association seemed plausible at the time – locomotor disease could lead to inactivity, which could cause respiratory disease. But Sackett repeated the analysis in a sample of 2783 individuals from the general population and found no association (odds ratio 1.06). The original analysis of hospitalized individuals was biased because both diseases caused individuals to be hospitalized. By looking only within the stratum of hospitalized individuals, Sackett had observed a distorted association. In contrast, in the general population (including a mix of hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals) locomotor disease and respiratory disease are not associated. In 1979, Sackett termed this phenomenon “admission rate bias”. With the help of causal diagrams (also known as directed acyclic graphs [DAGs]), this phenomenon can be explained by collider bias (Figure 1).\n\nIn this example, locomotor disease and respiratory disease are independent causes of hospitalization – the collider (since the two arrowheads collide into hospitalization). If the collider is controlled for by study design (selection bias), a distorted association will arise between locomotor and respiratory disease. This is what we see in Sackett’s 1979 example. Hypothetically, if he had statistically controlled for hospitalization in the general population dataset, he would have induced collider bias again, not through selection, but statistical error.",

            "prevent_en": "Randomization is the best way to reduce the risk of confounding. However, it may not be enough, particularly when it is anticipated that imbalances in prognostic factors may occur despite randomization, or when imbalances occur by chance. Stratification and statistical adjustment can reduce the risk of confounding in such cases.\n\nAn extension of this is the use of propensity scores, in which potential confounders are used to build a statistical model that assigns to each person a number called their propensity score: the people with high scores are more likely to have certain confounders, and those with low scores are less likely. The use of propensity scores in a study of metformin showed that the risk of cancers is lower in metformin users. But the randomized trial evidence, as far as it goes, shows no convincing evidence that metformin has any effect, illustrating the difficulty in adequately controlling for confounding.\n\nOn the other hand, a very large effect size can outweigh the combined effects of plausible confounders. Even if plausible confounders have not been ruled out by the design of the study, a large observed effect can swamp the combined effects of the confounders. For example, the observable effects of general anaesthesia are unlikely to be accountable by confounding, placebo effects, or any kinds of biases; in such cases, randomized trials may not even be necessary. In observational studies associations have to be dramatic if one wants to be confident that plausible confounders have been ruled out; this is true of both beneficial and harmful associations.",

Some studies showed that vaccine uptake was less likely in patients with chronic diseases, who were also less well, and therefore had a higher baseline risk of adverse health outcomes than healthy subjects. Unless adequate adjustment was made for the people who were less well when they received the vaccine, vaccine effectiveness may have been underestimated. Of the included 23 studies, the authors identified 17 (74%) that contained some form of confounding by indication. Twelve studies that reported all-cause mortality included adjustments for potential confounders (e.g. age, race, sex, comorbidities). Adjusting for confounders increased the beneficial effect of vaccination on all-cause mortality by 12% (95% CI: 7–17%).\n\nThe opposite effect (i.e. an overestimate of the size of the beneficial effect) can occur when participants who are vaccinated in a vaccine study have a lower prevalence of comorbidities, as indicated by baseline characteristics, than participants who are not vaccinated.

A consistent outcome across all indications will suggest that the outcome is indeed due to the exposure, since it is unlikely that each different indication would cause the same outcome.\n\nThis method was used in an observational study in which there was an increased incidence of oesophageal cancer in people taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs); in this case the potential confounder was the indication for treatment (the reason for using the PPIs). The observed outcome, an increased risk of oesophageal cancer, may have resulted from either the treatment or the indication for the treatment. To investigate this, Brusselaers and colleagues analysed their data by separately considering (a) indications with an increased risk of cancer, (b) indications with no known association, and (c) indications with a reduced risk. The analyses showed a persistent relationship across all three groups, suggesting a true association between PPIs and oesophageal cancer.\n\nDesigning the study to include different indications allowed the authors to stratify by different indications and to conclude from the interpretation of the results that the exposure rather than the indication was more likely to have caused the outcome.\n\nIn interpreting the results of observational studies one should always be aware of the possibility of confounding by indication and take care to consider it in one’s interpretation. Results can be analysed keeping in mind known confounders related to the indication, controlling statistically for their effects.

Trials with subjective outcomes (those based on feelings such as pain, rather than objectively measured outcomes such as diagnostic records) might be more at risk of bias from lack of blinding. For example, osteoarthritis trials tend to use patient-reported pain and function outcomes. A study looking at the influence of lack of blinding in 122 trials including 27,452 participants found that estimated treatment effects were smaller for trials with adequate blinding compared with trials with inadequate blinding.\n\nA systematic review of meta-analyses looked at the average bias and heterogeneity associated with reported methodological aspects of randomized controlled trials:\n\n“Lack of/unclear double blinding (versus double blinding, where both participants and personnel/assessors are blinded) was associated with a 23% exaggeration of intervention effect estimates in trials with subjective outcomes (ROR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93). In contrast, there was little evidence of such bias in trials of mortality or other objective outcomes, or when all outcomes were analysed (ROR 0.92, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.14;I2 33%).”",

            "background_en": "Data-dredging bias is a general category which includes a number of misuses of statistical inference (e.g. fishing, p-hacking), but each essentially involves probing the data in unplanned ways, finding and reporting an “attractive” result, without accurately conveying the course of analysis. For example, in nearly any analysis of data there are several “researcher degrees of freedom”— i.e., choices that must be made in the process of analysis. Ideally, these choices are guided by the principles of best practice and prespecified in a publicly available protocol. In contrast, p-hacking occurs when an initial analysis produces results which are close to being statistically significant, then, in absence of a study protocol, researchers can make analytic choices (e.g. how to handle outliers, whether to combine groups, including/excluding covariates) which will produce a statistically significant p-value.[1]\n\nWhile many different choices might be defensible, a canonical case of p-hacking would involve trying out multiple different options and reporting the result which yields the lowest p-value (particularly when alternative choices generate values that do not yield a significant result). Such an analysis can often generate statistically significant results in absence of a true effect (i.e. ‘false positives’) and is thus unreliable.\n\nThough some forms of data-dredging are lamentably common, it is important to note that often such problems arise from a lack of awareness rather than malfeasance.[2] As Gelman and Loken (2014) note, “it can seem entirely appropriate to look at the data and construct reasonable rules for data exclusion, coding, and analysis that can lead to statistical significance” (p. 461).[3] In such cases an unconscious tendency to interpret the results in a biased fashion can be guarded against by prespecifying the course of analysis.\n\nApart from p-hacking, other forms of data dredging include: assessing models with multiple combinations of variables and selectively reporting the “best” model (i.e., “fishing”);[4] making decisions about whether to collect new data on the basis of interim results; making post-hoc decisions about which statistical analyses to conduct; and generating a hypothesis to explain results which have already been obtained but presenting it as it were a hypothesis one had prior to collecting the data (i.e., HARKing (“hypothesizing after the results are known”)).[5] In general, these procedures are acceptable when transparently reported; however, when authors neglect to accurately report how the results were in fact generated, they are rightfully classified as data-dredging.",
            "background": "数据挖掘偏倚是一个很普遍的类型，其中包括很多对统计推断的误用(如：fishing、p-hacking)，涉及以研究方案计划外的方式对数据进行挖掘分析，从而呈现并报告“令人期待”的结论，而没有准确传达分析过程。例如，几乎在任何数据分析中都有一些环节需要“研究者选择”——即在分析过程中做出的必要选择。理想情况下，这些选择以最佳实践原则为指导，并在研究方案中中预先确定。相反，当初始分析结果产生了接近具有统计显著性时，就容易发生 p值篡改，然后，在没有研究方案没有明确界定的情况下，研究者可以做出分析中的一些选择（例如，如何处理异常值，是否合并组，纳入/排除协变量），这将产生具有统计意义的 p 值。 [1]\n\n虽然许多不同的选择可能是合理的，但 p-hacking 的典型案例将涉及尝试多个不同的选项并报告产生最低 p 值的结果（特别是当替代选择产生的值不会产生显着结果时）。这种分析通常可以在没有真实效果（即“假阳性”）的情况下产生统计上显着的结果，因此是不可靠的。\n\n尽管某些形式的数据疏浚非常普遍，但重要的是要注意，这些问题通常是由于缺乏意识而不是渎职造成的。 [2]正如 Gelman 和 Loken (2014) 指出的那样，“查看数据并为可能导致统计显着性的数据排除、编码和分析构建合理的规则似乎是完全合适的”（第 461 页）。 [3]在这种情况下，可以通过预先指定分析过程来防止以有偏倚的方式解释结果的无意识倾向。除了 p-hacking，其他形式的数据挖掘包括：评估具有多种变量组合的模型，并有选择地报告“最佳”模型（即“钓鱼”）；[4] 在此基础上决定是否收集新数据中期业绩；就进行哪些统计分析做出事后决定；并生成一个假设来解释已经获得的结果，但将其呈现为在收集数据之前的假设（即，HARKing（“已知结果后的假设”）。 [5]一般来说，这些程序在透明报告时是可以接受的；然而，当作者忽略准确报告结果实际上是如何产生的时，他们理所当然地被归类为数据挖掘。",
            "example_en": "Despite numerous published trials and meta-analyses which appear to support the use of progestogens to mitigate pregnancy loss, when trials were limited to those that have been preregistered the evidence does not support their use.[6] Of 93 randomized controlled trials, 22 were classified as unlikely to be p-hacked. Of these, only one produced a statistically significant result and a meta-analysis of the trials found evidence that progesterone was not effective (RR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.94-1.07). In contrast, most previous meta-analyses support the use of progestogens. It is unlikely that this difference is the result of publication bias since, given the ratio between non-significant to significant results in pre-registered trials, we should expect an enormous number of unpublished studies which found no statistically significant effect. Prior et. al. therefore suggest that the difference is likely due to the inclusion of studies susceptible to data-dredging in the previous meta-analyses.[6]\n\nThe work of Brian Wansink and the Cornell Food and Brand Lab presents a more extreme example, which has nevertheless become a paradigm case of data-dredging. In a November 2016 blog post Wansink described how, at his encouragement, a visiting scholar reanalyzed the data from a “failed” study a generated four articles supporting claims such as food tastes worse when buffet prices are low, and men eat more when dining with women in order to impress them. Investigations revealed that Wansink and his team strategized how to generate statistical analyses which would produce flashy results. Crucially, the process which the team engaged in to generate the results was not revealed in the published papers. Instead, the results were presented as if hypotheses were developed before the data were gathered. Further investigation uncovered almost a decade’s worth of emails in which Wansink and his team strategized ways to dredge through data to find results they felt would be easy to publish, including correspondence with the visiting scholar in which Wansink requests that she “squeeze some blood out of this rock”.[7]",
            "example": "尽管许多已发表的试验和荟萃分析似乎支持使用孕激素来减轻流产，但当试验仅限于那些已经预先注册的试验时，证据并不支持它们的使用。 [6]在 93 项随机对照试验中，22 项被归类为不太可能被 p-hacked。其中，只有一项产生了具有统计学意义的结果，一项对试验的荟萃分析发现有证据表明黄体酮无效（RR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.94-1.07）。相比之下，大多数先前的荟萃分析支持使用孕激素。这种差异不太可能是发表偏倚的结果，因为考虑到预注册试验中非显着结果与显着结果之间的比率，我们应该预计会有大量未发表的研究发现没有统计学意义的影响。先验等。人。因此表明差异可能是由于在先前的荟萃分析中纳入了易受数据挖掘影响的研究。 [6] Brian Wansink 和康奈尔食品与品牌实验室的工作提供了一个更极端的例子，但它已成为数据挖掘的典型案例。在 2016 年 11 月的一篇博客文章中，Wansink 描述了在他的鼓励下，一位访问学者如何重新分析了一项“失败”研究的数据，并生成了四篇文章支持这样的说法，例如自助餐价格低时食物味道更差，男性在用餐时吃得更多。女人为了给她们留下深刻印象。调查显示，万辛克和他的团队制定了如何生成统计分析的策略，从而产生华丽的结果。至关重要的是，该团队参与产生结果的过程并未在已发表的论文中披露。取而代之的是，呈现的结果好像是在收集数据之前就已经提出了假设。进一步的调查发现了将近十年的电子邮件，万辛克和他的团队在这些电子邮件中制定了策略性的方法来挖掘数据，以找到他们认为很容易发表的结果，包括与访问学者的通信，万辛克在其中要求她“挤出一些血液”这块石头”。 [7]",
            "impact_en": "Though there is no definitive account of the frequency of data-dredging or the severity of the bias it induces, evidence for its existence derives from the fact that there is an unusually large number of published studies with a p-value slightly less than p = .05.[8, 9, 10, 11] While some authors have concluded that p-hacking is unlikely to have had a significant effect on meta-analytic estimates,[12] this assumes that most meta-analyses will include a number of studies with large sample sizes. Authors using p-curve analyses have found that the distribution of p-values is consistent with most research investigating real effects; however, the data is also consistent with some forms of data-dredging.[13, 14] What is clear is that the bias induced by data-dredging will be most severe in cases where the effect size is small, the dependent measures are imprecise, research designs are flexible, and studies are conducted on small populations.[15]",
            "impact": "尽管没有明确说明数据挖掘的频率或它引起的偏差的严重程度，但其存在的证据来自以下事实：有异常大量的已发表研究，其 p 值略小于 p = .05.[8, 9, 10, 11] 虽然一些作者得出结论认为 p-hacking 不太可能对元分析估计产生重大影响，[12] 这假设大多数元分析将包括一些大样本量的研究。使用 p 曲线分析的作者发现 p 值的分布与大多数调查实际效果的研究一致。然而，这些数据也与某些形式的数据挖掘一致。 [13, 14] 很明显，数据挖掘引起的偏差在效应量较小、相关措施不精确的情况下最为严重，研究设计是灵活的，研究是在小人群中进行的。 [15]",
            "prevent_en": "John, Loewenstein, & Prelec (2012) find that researchers were generally unaware that data-dredging would induce bias.[2] Researchers frequently endorsed flawed practices such as deciding whether to gather more data after inspecting interim results or whether to exclude outliers after assessing the impact of doing so. Accordingly, there is hope that better statistical education would be beneficial. Authors should prespecify rules for stopping data collection, how to analyse data (including how to handle outliers, any expected transformations of the variables, what covariates will be controlled for, etc.) and studies should be sufficiently powered to detect meaningful effects. Publication of studies should list all variables collected in the study, report all planned analyses (specifying primary and secondary outcomes), and include robustness analyses for methodological choices.[1] Optimally, these choices should be registered prior to beginning the study[15]. When methodological decisions were informed by the data collected, the results should be clearly identified as an exploratory analysis and replicated.\n\nThe p-curve analysis has been suggested as a formal procedure for correcting p-hacking;[16, 17] however, its validity has not yet been established empirically. Particularly in non-randomized studies, confounding can render the p-curve analysis unreliable.[14]\n\nUltimately, as Banks et. al. (2016) have argued, data-dredging is a problem of bad barrels rather than bad apples because research systems incentivize producing nice-looking results.[19] Thus, one effective means of intervention would be to change the standards for conceiving, conducting, and publishing scientific research.[20] For example, the acceptance of articles on the basis of their design rather than their results would significantly alleviate the pressure to dredge data for “attractive” results.[21] Such alterations would represent sweeping changes for most disciplines.",

Observational studies may be at greater risk, particularly those relying on self-reports and retrospective data collection.  Although randomisation in intervention studies reduces the risk of bias and confounding, it can not entirely eradicate these (Shahar & Shahar 2009).\n\nMissing data can be a major cause of information bias, where certain groups of people are more likely to have missing data. An example where differential recording may occur is in smoking data within medical records.  Overall, smoking status is quite well recorded in primary care records, those with no record of smoking status are more likely to be ex-smokers or non-smokers than current smokers. Marston et al, 2014 ).  showed the overestimate might be as much as 8% for smoking status. Those who quit smoking at a young age or a long time ago were more likely to misclassified as non-smokers.\n\nNon-differential (random) misclassification of measures (where errors in measurements occur equally in all comparison groups) will tend to lead to an underestimation of effect.  Differential information bias (where there are different levels of inaccuracy between comparison groups) could work in either direction, resulting in an overestimate or underestimate of the true effect (Kesmodel, 2018). The bias was more likely when the exposure is dichotomized.",

If this is not possible, then the participants and investigators should be blind to the main hypotheses of the research.\n\nWhere possible, the information should be collected prospectively, using standardised methods and devices.  Where interviewers collect data, questions should be posed neutrally.\n\nOther techniques include utilising medical or work records to ascertain information, or to corroborate self-reported measures.\n\nClose attention to these details should occur at the design stage, as little can be done to address incorrect data.

This leads individuals to stop gathering information when the retrieved evidence confirms their own viewpoints, which can lead to preconceived opinions (prejudices) that are not based on reason or factual knowledge. Individuals then pick out the bits of information that confirm their prejudices.\n\nConfirmation bias has a long history. In 1620, Francis Bacon described confirmation bias as: “Once a man’s understanding has settled on something (either because it is an accepted belief or because it pleases him), it draws everything else also to support and agree with it. And if it encounters a larger number of more powerful countervailing examples, it either fails to notice them, or disregards them, or makes fine distinctions to dismiss and reject them, and all this with much dangerous prejudice, to preserve the authority of its first Conceptions.” (Bacon 1620)",

As a consequence, estimates of differences in survival time between people diagnosed from screening and those whose disease is detected after symptoms develop can be biased, as survival time will appear to be longer in screen-detected people if early detection has no effect on the course of disease (figure 1) or if survival time is extended (figure 2). Lead time bias is not the exception but the rule that comes with any successful effort to detect disease early.\n\nigure 1.

Breast cancer–specific 5-year survival was 82% among women not screened, 88% among women with irregular and 94% among regular users of screening. In response, Berry et al noted that although the authors had recognised that their study was subject to healthy person bias (where healthy patients tend to access screening), they had failed to take into account lead time bias. As lead time bias adds to the survival time of all women whose tumours were detected by screening, an increase in survival in the screened cohort compared to unscreened group is expected, and without appropriate adjustment, the observed difference could not be concluded as a survival benefit from screening. Media coverage of the mammography study conveyed stronger conclusions than perhaps the authors intended noted Berry et al, aided by a “misleading” press release from the American Society of Clinical Oncology which also failed to account for lead time bias.",

Extended survival may occur because early detection is effective but some of the observed benefit will be due to lead time bias.

This does not seem widely understood, even amongst health professionals and educators. In a survey of 297 primary care doctors presented with results from two hypothetical screening tests, 76% considered better survival as evidence that screening works. An observational study assessing statistical literacy in medical education settings found 50% of the 16 university professors and senior medical educators included failed to identify lead-time bias when presented.",

In observation settings, an alternative time origin to that of diagnosis may not be possible and comparisons of survival require adjustment for lead time bias. One such method is given by Duffy and colleagues. This method attempts to estimate the lead time bias for each patient and subtract this from the observed survival or censoring time to create a bias-adjusted overall survival time (figure 3). The authors applied their method to data from the Swedish Two-County study of breast cancer screening. After correction for lead time bias, the survival curve is lower than the uncorrected curve, suggesting that the positive effect of screening would otherwise have been overestimated.\n\nFigure 3.

Because of misclassification effects, self-reported weight and height could not reliably indicate the lowest-risk BMI category. Where an association between a category of body size and a health outcome is found, misclassification bias may have influenced that observation, sometimes increasing a risk estimate, sometimes decreasing it. This is important because understanding the relationship between obesity and underweight and health is a key factor in public health.\n\nThe study also highlights that the underlying hazards influence the way that misclassification affects risk estimates in each study, and the necessity to understand misclassification bias within the specific group or population under study and its effect on outcomes.",

In a study of two conditions in separate cohorts: severe renal failure and Colles’ fracture, true disease prevalence and relationship of the disease with other factors were measured and compared with results when disease status was determined using diagnostic codes.\n\n“Differences (‘misclassification bias’) were then adjusted for using two methods: quantitative bias analysis (QBA) with bias parameters (code sensitivity and specificity) of varying accuracy; and disease status imputation using bootstrap methods and disease probability models.”\n\nThe authors report that using quantitative bias analysis will not necessarily decrease bias. QBA is dependent upon the accuracy of the data when addressing bias. They recommend using values that are actually measured on the population used in the study (or ones that are similar to that in the study). The accuracy of recording each condition was less when using database diagnostic codes than using hospital biochemical data, and measures of disease association with covariables were also substantially affected.

Popularity bias could result from an increased awareness of the condition within the general population, making a condition “fashionable” and more likely to be cited as the cause of perhaps somewhat unspecific symptoms. For example, in the last decade, population awareness of coeliac disease (an autoimmune condition due to gluten intolerance) has led to large numbers of media articles on coeliac disease and related putative gluten intolerance syndromes. Sufferers of abdominal discomfort might be therefore more likely to suspect coeliac disease as the cause, and present to healthcare settings and seek investigations.\n\nAlso, a provider of health services might be the instigator of increased interest/popularity in a certain disease or condition. Advertisements by health providers for testing for conditions that otherwise might go undiagnosed, or otherwise might cause no overt health problems, could lead to an increase in “popularity” of presenting with certain symptoms or concern about a condition.\n\nBoth instances lead to selection bias. If a study is affected by popularity bias it could influence the results if certain groups of people were admitted to certain interventions or observations and other groups, which could happen over time, and these differences between groups might affect the study’s outcomes.\n\nThere is also a tendency for more popular items to be recommended more frequently and less popular ones rarely.",

Publication bias is a type of reporting bias and closely related to dissemination bias, although dissemination bias generally applies to all forms of results dissemination, not simply journal publications. A variety of distinct biases are often grouped into the overall definition of publication bias.\n\nThere are a number of reasons for publication bias identified in the literature. Research has shown causes of publication bias ranging from trialist motivation, past experience, and competing commitments; perceived or real lack of interest in results from editors, reviewers or other colleagues; or conflicts of interest that would lead to the suppression of results not aligned with a specific agenda.",

            "example_en": "In his 1986 piece on publication bias in clinical research Robert John Simes compared data reported to a cancer trial registry with data from the published literature on the survival impact of two cancer therapies. Simes found that in both instances the survival impact of the therapies either disappeared or was substantially less when the subset of data published in the academic literature was compared against the more complete data from a registry.\n\nPublication bias is commonly assessed in cohort studies, such as the Simes example, where publication status is ascertained for a group of known completed trials. Research into treatments for depression provides a more recent example. Turner and colleagues reported that 31% of a cohort of studies for antidepressant drugs registered and reported to the FDA were never published. The literature included 91% positive studies while the larger FDA cohort only contained 51% positive studies. Driessen and colleagues reviewed all NIH grants for psychological treatments for depression from 1972 to 2008. When publications were not found, the data was requested from the grant recipients. 13 out of 55 trials (23.6%) arising from this cohort were never published. The effect size of psychological treatments was reduced by 25% when unpublished data was included in the pooled analysis with the published data.\n\nResults of cohort studies such as these have been collected in systematic reviews. A 2013 systematic review by Dwan and colleagues reviewed 20 cohort studies on publication bias in randomized controlled trials and showed “statistically significant outcomes had a higher odds of being fully reported compared to non-significant outcomes (range of odds ratios: 2.2 to 4.7).” A 2014 systematic review by Schmucker and colleagues examined studies of publication and dissemination bias conducted using research approved by ethics committees or registered on a trial registry. They found that across 23 cohort studies “statistically significant results were more likely to be published than those without (pooled OR 2.8; 95% CI 2.2–3.5).”",
            "example": "在 1986 年关于临床研究“发表偏倚”的文献中，Robert John Simes 针对两种癌症疗法的生存影响，对比了“癌症试验注册处的数据”与“已发表文献中的数据”。 Simes 发现，在这两种数据情况下，当将学术文献中公布的数据子集与来自注册处的更完整数据进行比较时，治疗对生存的影响要么消失，要么大大减少。\n\n“发表偏倚”通常在队列研究中进行评估，例如： Simes 提到，发表状态确定已完成的试验。对抑郁症治疗的研究提供了一个更新的例子。 Turner 及其同事报告说，在向 FDA 注册和报告的抗抑郁药物的队列研究中，有 31% 的研究从未发表过。文献包括 91% 的阳性研究，而更大的 FDA 队列仅包含 51% 的阳性研究。 Driessen 及其同事审查了 1972 年至 2008 年 NIH 对抑郁症心理治疗的所有资金支持。当未找到发表文献时，向拨款接受者索取数据。来自该队列的 55 项试验中有 13 项（23.6%）从未发表过。当未发表的数据与已发表的数据进行汇总分析时，心理治疗的效果减少了 25%。\n\n此类队列研究的结果已在系统评价中收集。 2013年Dwan及同事的系统综述了20项随机对照试验，以这些RCT作为研究对象，针对“发表偏倚”进行队列研究，研究结果显示：“与非显著性结局相比，具有统计学意义的结局被充分报告的几率更高（优势比范围：2.2 至 4.7）。 ”  Schmucker 及其同事在 2014 年进行的系统评价审查了使用伦理委员会批准或在试验登记处注册的研究进行的发表和传播偏倚研究。他们发现，在 23 项队列研究中，“统计的显著结果比没有的更可能发表（合并 OR 2.8；95% CI 2.2-3.5）。”",

This can vary, from the non-publication of a single notable study, to compromising the complete assessment of a  therapeutic area. However, as with many biases, large-scale quantitative research has tended to focus on documenting the prevalence of publication bias, rather than its impact and assessing the direction and magnitude of bias can be difficult. Schmucker and colleagues conducted a systematic review examining studies on publication bias that additionally estimated the impact of unpublished studies on pooled effects. They found only seven studies, which showed an increase in precision of pooled effect when unpublished data was considered; and two studies which showed a statistically significant effect of unpublished data on the pooled estimates.",

However many of the documented barriers to publication cannot be addressed by the presence of journals receptive to null results.  \n\nThe preceding decade has seen various initiatives in the US and EU requiring certain trials to report results directly onto clinical trial registries in structured data format within 12 months of completion, providing an additional data source without the barriers to publication in academic journals. Sadly there is growing evidence that these laws and guidelines are undermined by loopholes and poor compliance.\n\nAuthors of systematic reviews and meta-analyses can also take steps to reduce the impact of non-publication on their work. The search for evidence should not be limited to only journal articles indexed in repositories such as PubMed or Ovid. Authors can and should search for results through other routes including trial registries, regulatory documents, and contacting trialists of known or suspected unpublished work. They can also use statistical methods to estimate if their sample of studies is likely impacted by publication bias. Funnel plots are a common way to visualise a skew in the publication of findings but should be interpreted carefully. More rigorous statistical methods for assessing publication bias exist and should be considered for use in meta-research when appropriate.",

Other issues that influence recall include age, education, socioeconomic status and how important the condition is to the patient.

            "example_en": "A study of the prevalence of Parkinson’s disease (PD) completed a door to door survey of an entire US county. They used a two-stage screening technique, first administering a comprehensive questionnaire and then referring those subjects with signs or symptoms suggestive of PD for a neurological evaluation. Over 97% of the households in the county participated. Some 15% of those screening positive in the first screen refused follow-up. Extensive efforts provided ‘valuable information on almost all the refusals which was reviewed by a neurologist to establish a diagnosis’. The authors presented convincing evidence that they had succeeded in obtaining a complete enumeration of PD cases in the county.\n\nOf the approximately 24,000 residents on prevalence day, 1 January 1978, PD was diagnosed in 31 participants. Thirteen of those 31 had never been seen for medical care. In this survey, if another approach to the ascertainment of cases had used only the medical care system, all of those who had not received care (over 40%) would not have been identified. Furthermore, there would have been no definitive way of characterizing the bias introduced if only those identified via health records were used.\n\nAnother example is the effect of HRT on coronary heart disease (CHD) in women. Several studies showed that HRT reduced coronary heart disease (CHD), but subsequent RCTs showed that HRT might increase the risk of CHD disease. The Women in the observational studies on HRT were more health conscious, more physically active, and had higher socioeconomic status than those not on HRT. This self-selection of women (selection bias) led to confounding and a “healthy-user bias”.\n\nIn a double-blind placebo-controlled study of the use of phenobarbital for prevention of recurrent febrile seizures, adherence was not as good as hoped. The Kaplan-Meier curves for remaining free from seizures were not statistically significantly different from each other, contrary to expectation. The authors used several definitions of adherence and reanalysed the results ‘as treated’. The results based on one definition of adherence showed that adherent subjects in both the phenobarbital and the placebo groups had a higher risk of recurrence than those who were non-adherent. The results were thus conflicting and demonstrated selection bias due to attrition.\n\nProspective cohort studies of dietary and lifestyle factors exhibit a “healthy participant effect”, reporting lower mortality rates among participants than among the general population. This suggests that people who are interested in healthy lifestyles, and therefore have more healthy behaviours, such as low smoking rates, are more likely to sign up to take part in a prospective study than those with less healthy lifestyles. This can also be considered a sampling bias\n\nA study of cigarette smoking and dementia found potential selection bias in the elderly. Selection bias due to censoring by death was one explanation for the lower relative rate of dementia in smokers with increasing age.",
            "example": "一项关于帕金森病 (PD) 患病率的研究完成了对整个美国县的挨家挨户调查。他们使用了两阶段筛选技术，首先进行全面的问卷调查，然后将那些有 PD 迹象或症状的受试者转介进行神经系统评估。全县97%以上的家庭参与。大约 15% 的第一次筛查呈阳性的人拒绝随访。广泛的努力提供了“关于几乎所有拒绝的宝贵信息，神经科医生审查了这些信息以建立诊断”。作者提供了令人信服的证据，证明他们成功地获得了该县 PD 病例的完整计数。在 1978 年 1 月 1 日流行日的大约 24,000 名居民中，有 31 名参与者被诊断为 PD。这 31 人中有 13 人从未接受过医疗护理。在本次调查中，如果仅使用医疗系统来确定病例的另一种方法，则所有未接受治疗的人（超过 40%）都不会被识别出来。此外，如果仅使用通过健康记录确定的偏差，就没有明确的方法来表征引入的偏差。另一个例子是 HRT 对女性冠心病 (CHD) 的影响。几项研究表明，HRT 可降低冠心病 (CHD)，但随后的 RCT 表明 HRT 可能会增加 CHD 疾病的风险。与未接受 HRT 的女性相比，HRT 观察性研究中的女性更注重健康、更活跃，社会经济地位更高。这种对女性的自我选择（选择偏见）导致了混淆和“健康用户偏见”。在一项关于使用苯巴比妥预防复发性热性惊厥的双盲安慰剂对照研究中，依从性不如预期。与预期相反，保持无癫痫发作的 Kaplan-Meier 曲线在统计学上没有显着差异。作者使用了几种依从性定义，并重新分析了“治疗后”的结果。基于一种依从性定义的结果表明，苯巴比妥组和安慰剂组的依从性受试者比非依从性受试者具有更高的复发风险。因此，结果是相互矛盾的，并证明了由于减员造成的选择偏差。饮食和生活方式因素的前瞻性队列研究显示出“健康参与者效应”，报告参与者的死亡率低于一般人群。这表明对健康生活方式感兴趣并因此具有更健康行为（例如低吸烟率）的人比那些生活方式不太健康的人更有可能报名参加一项前瞻性研究。这也可以被认为是抽样偏差 一项关于吸烟和痴呆症的研究发现了老年人的潜在选择偏差。由于死亡审查导致的选择偏倚是吸烟者随着年龄的增长而导致痴呆症相对较低的一种解释。",
            "impact_en": "Selection bias can have varying effects, and the magnitude of its impact and the direction of the effect is often hard to determine. (Odgaard-Jensen J et al.)\n\nAs examples, a meta-epidemiological study of the Impact of Selection Bias on Treatment Effect Size Estimates in Randomized Trials of Oral Health Interventions found significantly larger treatment effect estimates in trials that had inadequate/unknown sequence generation (difference in ES = 0.13; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.25). A further study to determine survival in preterm infant cohort studies found that the presence of selection bias overestimated survival by as much as 100%.",
            "impact": "选择偏差会产生不同的影响，其影响的大小和影响的方向通常很难确定。 （Odgaard-Jensen J 等人）例如，一项关于选择偏倚对口腔健康干预随机试验中治疗效果大小估计的影响的元流行病学研究发现，在序列生成不足/未知的试验中，治疗效果估计明显更大（ES 差异 = 0.13；95% CI：0.01 至 0.25）。在早产儿队列研究中确定存活率的进一步研究发现，选择偏差的存在高估了存活率高达 100%。",
            "prevent_en": "To assess the probable degree of selection bias, authors should include the following information at different stages of the trial or study:\n\n– Numbers of participants screened as well as randomised/included.\n\n– How intervention/exposure groups compared at baseline.\n\n– To what extent potential participants were re-screened.\n\n– Exactly what procedures were put in place to prevent prediction of future allocations and knowledge of previous allocations.\n\n– What the restrictions were on randomisation, e.g. block sizes.\n\n– Any evidence of unblinding.\n\n– How missing data from participants lost to follow-up were handled.\n\nRandomisation of participants in intervention studies aims to provide the fairest method of comparing the effect of an intervention with a control, and preventing selection biases is part of this aim. However, it may not be perfectly achieved. Berger and colleagues have made clear arguments for the crucial role of adequate allocation concealment and randomisation procedures to prevent selection biases.\n\nBecause anything that happens after randomisation can affect the chance that a study participant has the outcome of interest, it is essential that all patients (even those who fail to take their medicine or accidentally or intentionally receive the wrong treatment) are analysed in the groups to which they were allocated. The intention-to-treat analysis includes data from all the participants randomly assigned to the treatment comparison groups, whether or not they received the treatment to which they were assigned, even if they never started the treatment, or switched to a different one during the study. This prevents bias caused by disruption of the baseline equivalence established by random allocation.\n\nIn Observational studies selection bias is difficult to address with analytical methods, but methods for dealing with missing data are available, including last observation (or baseline value) carried forward, mixed models, imputation, and sensitivity analysis using ‘worst case’ scenarios (assuming that those with no information all got worse) and ‘best case’ scenarios (assuming that all got better). Analysing data only from participants remaining in the study is called complete case analysis.\n\nCertain external measures can sometimes be used to calibrate the data from a study, an example being standardised mortality rates. Moreover, inverse probability weighting can be used under certain assumptions.\n\nTo improve generalisability of study findings the selection of the population should be broad and reported in the recruitment/inclusion criteria.",

They defined ‘spin’ in the context of a trial with statistically nonsignificant primary outcomes as follows:\n\n‘the use of specific reporting strategies, from whatever motive, to highlight that the experimental treatment is beneficial, despite a statistically nonsignificant difference for the primary outcome, or to distract the reader from statistically nonsignificant results.’\n\nThey identified 72 randomized control trials in which there were no statistically significant between-group differences in the primary outcomes. They examined both the report abstract and main text of each article and found that more than 68% of abstracts and 61% of the main texts had some form of spin.\n\nThe analysis identified many strategies for spinning (see Table 2 in their paper). Among the most common techniques were focusing reports on statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes, or focusing on another study objective to distract readers’ attention from a statistically non-significant difference.\n\nA more recent systematic review explored the nature, prevalence and implications of spin in 35 reports that met the inclusion criteria. The review included studies that investigated the association of spin with the following factors:\n\n● conflicts of interest and study funding;\n● author characteristics;\n● journal characteristics and\n● study design and/or quality\n\nHowever, the authors pointed out that the heterogeneity and the small number of studies limited the strength of the conclusions.",

They must resist the temptation to play up (or play down) their research findings, but also resist the pressure of other parties seeking to do the same, such as the publicity department of an institution.\n\nThe results from a 2019 randomised trial suggested that not spinning findings did not harm news and media interest.\n\nEvidence used for decision making should not be based on single studies, but instead, be informed by systematic reviews of relevant research. However, as highlighted in another analysis, evidence users should be aware of the spin that can infect systematic reviews. Research submissions to journals should be accompanied by full data sets (where ethically appropriate), to allow subsequent reanalysis and promote replication. Some journals are already asking for this.\n\nEvidence users can also consider using tools to help detect spin. Nine of the included studies in the Chiu et al.

            "background_en": "Reporting biases is an umbrella term that covers a range of different types of biases. It is described as the most significant form of scientific misconduct (Al-Marzouki et al. 2005). Reporting biases have been recognised for hundreds of years, dating back to the 17th century (Dickersin & Chambers, 2010). Since then, various definitions of reporting biases have been proposed:\n\nThe Dictionary of Epidemiology defines reporting bias as the “selective revelation or suppression of information (e.g., about past medical history, smoking, sexual experiences) or of study results.”\nThe Cochrane Handbook states it arises “when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results.”\nThe James Lind Library states “biased reporting of research occurs when the direction or statistical significance of results influence whether and how research is reported.”\nOur definition of reporting biases is a distortion of presented information from research due to the selective disclosure or withholding of information by parties involved with regards to the topic selected for study and the design, conduct, analysis, or dissemination of study methods, findings or both. Researchers have previously described seven types of reporting biases, including publication bias, time-lag bias, multiple (duplicate) publication bias, location bias, citation bias, language bias and outcome reporting bias (Higgins & Green. 2011). Figure 1 illustrates where reporting biases can occur in the lifecycle of research and provides several examples of reporting biases.",
            "background": "报告偏差是一个涵盖一系列不同类型偏倚的总称。它被描述为最重要的科学不端行为形式（Al-Marzouki et al. 2005）。数百年来，报告偏见已经得到认可， （Dickersin & Chambers，2010）。从那时起，人们提出了各种报告偏倚的定义：\n《流行病学词典》将报告偏倚定义为“选择性地揭示或压制信息（例如，关于过去的病史、吸烟、性经历）或研究结果”。\n Cochrane 手册指出，“当研究结果的传播受到结果的性质和方向的影响时”。\n詹姆斯林德图书馆指出“当结果的方向或统计意义影响研究是否以及如何报告时，就会出现有偏见的研究报告。”\n我们对报告偏差的定义是，由于参与方选择性地披露或隐瞒有关选择进行研究的主题以及研究方法、结果或两者的设计、实施、分析或传播的信息，导致研究中呈现的信息失真.研究人员之前已经描述了七种报告偏差，包括发表偏差、时滞偏差、多重（重复）发表偏差、位置偏差、引用偏差、语言偏差和结果报告偏差（Higgins & Green. 2011）。图 1 说明了报告偏差在研究生命周期中可能发生的位置，并提供了几个报告偏差的示例。",
            "example_en": "A narrative review conducted by McGauran and colleagues (2010) found reporting biases are a widespread phenomenon in the medical literature. They identified reporting biases in 50 types of pharmacological, surgical, diagnostic and preventative interventions which included the withholding of study data or the active attempt by manufacturers to suppress the publication of findings.\n\nA systematic review by Jones and colleagues (2015) compared the outcomes of randomised controlled trials specified in registered protocols with those in subsequent peer-reviewed journal articles. There were discrepancies between prespecified and reported outcomes in a third of the studies. Thirteen per cent of trials introduced a new outcome in the published articles compared with those specified in the registered protocols.\n\nIn a cohort study of Cochrane systematic reviews, Saini and colleagues (2014) found 86% of reviews did not report data on the main harm outcome of interest.\n\nAnother cohort study found considerable inconsistency in the reporting of adverse events when comparing sponsors databases with study protocols (Scharf & Colevas, 2006). In 14 of the 22 included studies, the number of adverse events in the sponsor’s database differed from the published articles by 20% or more.\n\nWhen more detailed information for interventions was analysed for oseltamivir trials, over half (55%) of the previous risk of bias assessments were reclassified from ‘low’ risk of bias to ‘high’ (Jefferson et al. 2014).",

When the evidence base available to clinicians, policymakers or patients is incomplete or distorted, healthcare decisions and recommendations are made on biased evidence.\n\nVioxx (Rofecoxib), a Cox-2 inhibitor prescribed for osteoarthritis pain, provides an important example of under-reporting and misreporting of data which led to significant patient harm.\n\nThe first safety analysis of the largest study of Rofecoxib found a 79% greater risk of death or serious cardiovascular event in one treatment group compared with the other (Krumholz et al., 2007). This information was not disclosed by the manufacturer (Merck), and the trial continued. The cardiovascular risk associated with Rofecoxib was obscured in several ways.\n\nA number of significant conflicts of interest among board members of Merck were undisclosed, and not made public while the trial was in progress or when it was published (Krumholz et al., 2007). Merck now faces legal claims from nearly 30,000 people who experienced adverse cardiovascular events while taking Rofecoxib.\n\nIf benefits are over-reported and harms are under-reported, clinicians, patients and the public will have a false sense of security about the safety of treatments. This results in unnecessary suffering and death (Cowley et al. 1993), perpetuates research waste and misguides future research (Glasziou & Chalmers, 2018).",

This was a result of ascertainment bias, but the point is, don’t be fooled by the size of the sample.",

            "prevent_en": "To prevent wrong sample size bias, when designing studies, it is essential that statistical advice is sought. When interpreting results, do not be persuaded purely by large numbers and small confidence intervals: consider rational explanations for the observed findings, and the relevance of the effect size observed. Be cautious in using p-values to support or disprove hypotheses, especially when a large number of statistical tests to provide the p-values have been done.  \n\nVery large observational studies, such as the Million Women Study, instead of using 95% confidence intervals to indicate confidence in the estimate, sometimes use 99% confidence intervals.\n\nAnother area in which more stringent levels for statistical significance are set is in genome-wide association studies, which deal with vast amounts of data and examine large numbers of associations. For the gene discovery work in these studies, it is more critical to avoid false-positives than to miss some true associations; therefore, it is has been the convention for these to use a much more stringent statistical significance level.",

(Eds). 1966. We have been unable to locate a copy of this work, but have identified other work by this author on this subject. In 1959, Yerushalmy and Palmer discussed the use of substitutes in medical research, as in a) substitutes for disease as outcome measures b) substitutes for factors suspected of causing disease.\n\nThe authors urged caution in using substitutes when attempting to prove causality, largely because the substitute might lack specificity and may not hold a direct relation with the disease.\n\nPrentice (1989) recommended that appropriate surrogate markers of disease must correlate with the clinical outcome of interest, and also fully capture the effect of an intervention or exposure on that outcome. Whilst it can be easy to find surrogate markers that are correlated with the disease of interest, it is much more difficult for those markers to wholly capture effects of an intervention or exposure on the disease outcome.\n\nProblems with the use of surrogate markers can include\n\nLack of precision in estimating the surrogate marker\nEffect of the outcome back on the marker (a problem in retrospective studies: sometimes the marker is influenced by recent events)\nThe time frame needs to be appropriate; the marker must reflect exposure in the correct time frame relevant for the development of disease\nTechnical issues with measurement of biomarkers e.g. consistency over time, consistency between different laboratories.\nBiological variation of biomarkers e.g. over the menstrual cycle among reproductive-age women needs to be understood and taken into account.\n\n“Surrogate outcomes are often used in clinical trials as substitutes for final patient relevant outcomes. Advantages of surrogate outcomes over final outcomes are that they may occur faster or may be easier to assess, thereby shortening the duration, size, and cost of trials. A key rationale for the use of surrogate outcomes in trials is not only substitution but the prediction of treatment benefit in the absence of data on patient relevant outcomes.”\n\nComparison of treatment effect sizes associated with surrogate and final patient relevant outcomes in randomised controlled trials: meta-epidemiological study.

Furthermore, we found that surrogate trials were twice as likely to report positive treatment effects as the final outcome trials. These findings were not explained by differences in risk of bias or other trial characteristics and are comparable\nwith the level of exaggeration of treatment effect attributed to inadequate allocation concealment.”\n\nThis analysis showed that on average, trials using surrogate primary outcomes reported larger treatment effects than a matched sample of trials using patient relevant primary outcomes.

For example, in the assessment of medical images, one observer might record an abnormality but another might not. Different observers might tend to round up or round down a measurement scale. Colour change tests can be interpreted differently by different observers. Where subjective judgement is part of the observation, there is great potential for variability between observers, and some of these differences might be systematic and lead to bias. Observation of objective data, such as death, is at much lower risk of observer bias.\n\nBiases in recording objective data may result from inadequate training in the use of measurement devices or data sources or unchecked bad habits. By recording subjective data, predispositions of the observer are likely to underpin observer biases. Observers might be somewhat conscious of their own biases about a study or may be unaware of factors influencing their decisions when recording study information.\n\nRandomized controlled trials are designed to provide the fairest test of an intervention.

            "impact_en": "Hróbjartsson and colleagues produced three systematic reviews estimating the size of the impact of observer bias, by comparing estimates from studies in which outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention with those in which outcome assessors were not blinded. Three types of RCTs were investigated: those with binary outcomes; RCTs with measurement scale outcomes and RCTs with time-to-event outcomes.\n\nThe studies included a range of conditions from angina to wound treatment to psychiatric disorders. For RCTs with binary outcomes, non-blinded outcome assessors generated odds ratios that, on average, were exaggerated by 36%. For clinical trials that used measurement scale outcomes, non-blinded outcome assessment exaggerated effect size by 68% (6). For RCTs using time-to-event outcomes, non-blinded assessment overstated the hazard ratio by approximately 27%.",
            "impact": "Hróbjartsson 及其同事通过比较结果评估者对干预措施不知情的研究与结果评估者不知情的研究的估计值，制作了三项系统评价，估计了观察者偏见的影响大小。研究了三种类型的随机对照试验：具有二元结果的随机对照试验；具有测量量表结果的 RCT 和具有事件发生时间结果的 RCT。这些研究包括从心绞痛到伤口治疗再到精神疾病的一系列疾病。对于具有二元结果的 RCT，非盲法结果评估者产生的优势比平均被夸大了 36%。对于使用测量量表结果的临床试验，非盲法结果评估将效应量夸大了 68% (6)。对于使用事件发生时间结果的 RCT，非盲法评估夸大了风险比约 27%。",
            "prevent_en": "A key method is to ensure that outcome assessors are blinded to the exposure status of study participants. This can apply to randomised controlled trials, in which an individual has been allocated a particular intervention, and also to observational studies, which track the progress of study participants with different exposures. Achieving blinding might mean separating access for data on exposures from data on outcomes; in a blinded trial the allocation should remain unknown throughout the study (unless it must be revealed for safety reasons).\n\nStrategies can also include adequate training for observers in how to record findings, identifying any potential conflicts before recordings commence and clearly defining the methods, tools and time frames for collecting data.\n\nAnother preventive aspect includes training study observers to become aware of their prejudices and habits, in order to improve accuracy. One study on blood pressure looked at training procedures designed to reduce observer bias and how long they lasted. The study showed nurses had biases in either under or over reporting blood pressure; training did reduce the between-nurse variation but differences remained and were not changed by training at various time points.\n\nWhilst observer bias can be reduced, it is likely that observer bias will always remain, and researchers should be aware of this when analysing and evaluating data.",
            "prevent": "一个关键方法是确保结果评估者对研究参与者的暴露状态不知情。这可以适用于随机对照试验，其中个体被分配了特定的干预，也适用于观察性研究，它跟踪不同暴露的研究参与者的进展。实现盲法可能意味着将暴露数据的访问与结果数据的访问分开；在盲法试验中，分配应在整个研究过程中保持未知（除非出于安全原因必须公开）。策略还可以包括对观察员进行充分培训，了解如何记录发现，在记录开始之前识别任何潜在的冲突，并明确定义收集数据的方法、工具和时间框架。另一个预防方面包括培训研究观察员了解他们的偏见和习惯，以提高准确性。一项关于血压的研究着眼于旨在减少观察者偏见的培训程序及其持续时间。研究表明，护士在报告血压偏低或偏高方面存在偏见。培训确实减少了护士之间的差异，但差异仍然存在，并且在不同时间点的培训没有改变。虽然可以减少观察者的偏见，但观察者的偏见很可能会一直存在，研究人员在分析和评估数据时应该意识到这一点。",

For instance, studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of faecal occult blood test (FOBT) often only use a confirmatory colonoscopy on those that test positive on FOBT.\n\nAlthough these designs may have been used for ethical or funding restrictions, they introduce the potential for verification bias. A  meta-analysis comparing the diagnostic accuracy of FOBT for colorectal cancer found that ‘the pooled sensitivity of FOBT without verification bias was significantly lower (.36 vs. 0.70) than those studies with this bias. The pooled specificity of the studies without verification bias was also higher (0.96 vs.0.88).
